# HoneySelect VRmod with LRE & IBL

This mod is for integrating existing VirtualReality HoneySelect mod (VRmod) with Linear Rendering Experiment (LRE) and Image Based Lighting (IBL),
and adding some improvements. All post-processing effects (from UnityStandardAssets), functions of Camera lens, Skyboxes(Cubemaps) and Lighting functions
have been able to be used on Honey Select VR environment.
The main way to use this mod have already been referred on the site of existing each mod.
If User wants to know about each mod in detail, please see them.

Thanks very much, these autors!

## [Installation]
1. Extract the zip file into User's HoneySelect directory.
2. Run (HoneySelect|StudioNEO)_(64|32)_for_VR_with_IBL
3. Enjoy super high quality on VR!

**Caution!** 
- This mod might rewrite some existing files and cause some bugs depending on User's environment.
  Please back up Game root folder before installing necessarily.
- This mod has no internet connections at all. If User encounters any Firewall problem, it would be by original Game. All origianl codes before changing are from authors cited above and the provider has added no codes about outgoing connections. However if you see documents on web from clicking on IBL GUI, the limitation shall not be applied to.
- This mod will often have heavy loads on memory especially, so User might get freezed or encounter PC crashes on VR execution. 
  In the case, User can decrease the number of post-processing effects or also have no effects (ApplyShaders = false).
  Please be careful to avoid any probelm caused by the case.
- Chara texture will get weird on Title, (enabling/disabling) self shadow, switching (seated/standing) mode, applying shader (as long as known as of now).
  The provider doesnt know about this reason very sorry. If User encounters this problem, initialize scene or chara.
  Until quitting Application , it will not happen twice. 
- Whether or not User has already installed noraml IBL or LRE, this mod works only on VR execution(command option = "--vr") not depending on it. Normal IBL&LRE are separeted from IBL&LRE of this mod during Application execution, so both dont influence with each other.   
- ${***_(64|32)_Data}\Managed\IllusionInjector.dll in this mod controlls this mod's LRE&IBL on VR. If User changes this DLL, on VR execution User might encounter any bugs. Use the DLL and this mod's LRE&IBL together. 
- User had not better display any other windows except for this Game window on PC Screen. If cursor on other windows, controllers might not get reactive. Cursor-confined function on Game window is a little irregular yet.

## Modes & Controls

HoneySelectVR comes in two *modes*:

| Mode        | Description         |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| Seated      | *Default mode.* This mode lets you play the game with a mouse, keyboard, or gamepad.<br />The controls are essentially the same as in the main game. The screen is presented on a big monitor in front of you. |
| Standing    | As soon as tracked controllers are registered by the game, it switches into *standing mode*, also called *room scale mode*. In this mode, you can freely move around and use your Vive or Touch controllers to stuff. |

### Common Mode
On both Seated and Standing Mode, same shortcuts would be used.

#### Keyboard Shortcuts

### Seated Mode

As stated earlier, the controls are basically the same as in the main game with the exception of a few VR-related shortcuts. You are presented with a screen in front of your that replaces your monitor and can be configured via the settings or via shortcuts (see below).

#### Keyboard Shortcuts

:----:     | ------
<kbd>F4</kbd> | Switch GUI projection mode (flat, curved, spherical).
<kbd>F7</kbd> | Toggle camera lock (disabled by default). This prevents the camera to *tilt* because such movements are known to cause cyber sickness.

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> | Impersonate a chara Exactly along User's line of sight (matching all x, y, z position)

### Standing Mode

The *standing mode* is where things start to get interesting. This mode is pretty much disconnected from the usual game in that it comes with its very own controls -- although you can still use your mouse and your keyboard.

## Tools

These tools are mainly meant to be used in *standing mode* but some of them are also available in *seated mode*. By default, your left hand will start with the *menu tool* and your right hand will start with the *warp tool*. In order to change them on either hand, press the *menu button* on your Vive controller. [See here an overview of buttons](https://forums.unrealengine.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=87367&d=1460020388).

**You can get in-game help any time by holding the menu button!**

### Menu Tool (seated / standing)
![menu_tool](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68005887/89115910-d62c5a00-d4c8-11ea-8fe4-e96d8b8173ba.png)  

With the *menu tool* you can interact with the user interface of the game. There are, in fact, two ways you can control the mouse: a two-handed way that makes use of a laser pointer, and a one-handed way that lets you use your trackpad like a ... touchpad!

#### Laser pointer
![laser_pointer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68005887/89115930-0f64ca00-d4c9-11ea-84d9-7c39582e845a.jpg)  

To use the laser pointer, simply point the *other controller* at the menu screen. A laser pointer will appear and you can easily interact with the UI. To make a click, press the trigger button.

#### Trackpad

To use the trackpad, slide with your thumb over the trackpad and the mouse cursor will move accordingly. To make a click, press the trackpad.

#### Attaching, Detaching and Resizing the Menu
![scale](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68005887/89115937-20154000-d4c9-11ea-96f9-975ffb9da280.jpg)  


It's possible to detach and resize the menu you're holding at any point in the game.

Simply press the grip button to "let go" of the menu screen -- the screen will then stay put where you left it. You can even use other tools and still interact with the screen using the *laser pointer* mechanism.

Furthermore, it's possible to *resize* the screen. In order to do that, point both your controllers at a screen, press the trigger button, and move the controllers apart. It's also possible to move the screen around like this.

Lastly, to take control of the screen again, press the grip button once more.

#### UI/UX abstract on Menu
Tag      |  Move   | 
----     | ------  | 
only one hand needed
<kbd>trackpad</kbd>+<kbd>move</kbd> | move mouse cursor
<kbd>trigger</kbd> | click mouse cursor
<kbd>menu</kbd> | display menu
<kbd>grip</kbd> | put GUI or grab put GUI
both hands needed
<kbd>trigger</kbd>+<kbd>trigger</kbd> | resize put GUI.

### Warp Tool (standing)
![warp_tool](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68005887/89115946-358a6a00-d4c9-11ea-87b0-ba7e6088070a.png)  

The *warp tool* is only available in room scale mode and allows you to jump around in the scene.

#### Warping

In order to warp, touch the trackpad, choose your position and press. While touching the trackpad you are able to see:

1. Where you will warp to
2. Your play area
3. A HMD that further shows where your head will be

You can also *rotate* your play area while touching the trackpad by drawing circles with your thumb.

![warp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68005887/89115953-49ce6700-d4c9-11ea-811b-39a77fc49fe3.jpg)  

#### Changing Scale and Height

It's also possible to change scale and height with this tool, although it's a bit cumbersome at the moment. To do this, hold the trackpad *pressed* before warping. You can now change your future height by moving the Vive controller up and down and your scale by moving back and forth. Note that you can only change one of those two each time.

By pressing the *grip button* you can reset the scale and height.

#### UI/UX abstract on Warp
By improved UI/UX and leap functions, User can easily move where User want.

## Settings & Tweaks

Settings can be changed in the file *vr_settings_for_IBL.xml*, which is generated the first time you start the game. Use `RenderScale` to tweak the resolution, **not** the internal resolution dialog, as that one will currently only change the resolution of the GUI.

Tag      | Default | Effect | Mode
----     | ------  | ------ | ----
`<Distance>` | 0.1 | Sets the distance between the camera and the GUI at `[0,0,0]`. | Seated
`<Angle>` | 170 | Sets the width of the arc the GUI takes up.  | Seated
`<IPDScale>` | 0.83 | Sets the scale of the camera. The higher, the more gigantic the player is. | Seated / Standing
`<OffsetY>` | 0 | Sets the vertical offset of the GUI in meters. | Seated
`<Rotation>` | 0 | Sets by how many degrees the GUI is rotated (around the y / up axis) | Seated
`<Rumble>` | True | Sets whether or not rumble is activated. | Seated / Standing
`<RenderScale>` | 1 | Sets the render scale of the renderer. Increase for better quality but less performance, decrease for more performance but poor quality. | Seated / Standing
`<MirrorScreen>` | False | Sets whether or not the view should be mirrored in the game window. | Seated / Standing
`<ApplyShaders>` | true | Sets whether or not post-processing shaders should automatically be applied to the camera. | Seated / Standing
`<NearClip>` | 0.01 | Within this distance, seen chara gets transparent. | Seated / Standing
`<PitchLock>` | false | Whether or not can rotate on all axises (unlocked = false) | Seated
`<Projection>` | flat | The appearance of GUI seen | Seated
`<SpeechRecognition>` | false | Whether or not speech recognition is enabled. | Seated / Standing
`<RotationMultiplier>` | 2.5 | Accelaration of rotation | Seated / Standing
`<Leap>` | true | Whether or not Leap Motion support is activated. | Standing 
`<GrabRotationImmediateMode>` | true | Determines the rotation mode. If enabled, pulling the trigger while grabbing will immediately rotate you. When disabled, doing the same thing will let you 'drag' the view. | Standing
 `<DefaultDistanceOfLeap>` | 0.5 | Default distance up to chara on leaping. | Standing
 `<SpeedOfMouseWheel>` | 3 | speed of mouse wheel on PlayTool | Seated / Standing

## Building HoneySelectVR

HoneySelectVR depends on the [VRGIN](https://github.com/Eusth/VRGIN) library which is included as a submodule. It is therefore important that when you clone the project, you clone it recursively.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Eusth/HoneySelectVR.git
cd HoneySelectVR
```

After cloning the repo and setting up the submodule, you should be able to compile the project by simply opening the *.sln file and building.

Note that there is a build configuration called "Install" that will extract your Honey Select Trial install directory from the registry and copy the files where they belong.
